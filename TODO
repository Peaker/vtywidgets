* Nicer navigation:
  * Widget's EventMap should have Widget.Event as its key

  * Add DirectionEntry event type, and move Grid to that position

* Widgets that take a lot of "configuration" should either not take it
  (compose the attrs outside) or should take a record that has
  defaults

* newtype WidgetAction m = WidgetAction (Widget (m (WidgetAction m)))
  * runWidgetLoop :: WidgetAction IO -> IO ()

* Try to remove any mention of "Vty" and rename "VtyWidgets" to "FPWidgets"?

* Use AddBounds or such instead of the maxBoundHack stuff
* Scroll, Grid are pretty ugly

* TextEdit:
  * Keep track of diffs
