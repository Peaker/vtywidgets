* Replace the IO debug log op with a "withDebug" which puts the debug
  info somewhere on screen?  Keeps its own state in the loop
  * It's not that important!

* Nicer navigation:
  * Keymap -> Eventmap
  * Add DirectionEntry event type, and move Grid to that position

* Scroll:
  * If I make a "follow-view", I need it to be in State, which makes
    it less composable...
  * Maybe need FRP framework so Scroll is exposed to all of the model
    changes, or maybe Scroll can get a history or such

* Cleanups:
  * Maybe succumb to inclusive/inclusive Haskell ranges?
  * Use AddLimits or such instead of the maxBoundHack stuff
  * Scroll, Grid are pretty ugly
  * Various "make" widget funcs, move various params that the
    SizeRange doesn't depend on to be imgarg

* TextEdit:
  * Keep track of diffs
