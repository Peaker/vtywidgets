* Grid

  * Instead of Grid neutralizing non-current children -- they should
    do so themselves, based on HasFocus

    * This way, all widgets can implement "global" bindings that do
      whatever they want

    * No ugly clearing of the keymap and image cursor of grid children

  * Clip the subwidget images:
    Image.clip :: Monoid a => IntersectRect -> Endo (Image a)

    mempty for any out-of-intersection position, to not break the
    guarantee that nothing is outside the clip rect of the image

* Scroller:

  * Can take a (widget, focusArea) and make sure the focusArea is in
    range of the scroll

* PotentialScroller:

  * Choose a Scroller or the widget, based on whether or not it fits
    in the given space...

* TextEdit:

  * Arg for max num of lines
