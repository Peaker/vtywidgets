* Display should have a Functor in it

* Big "Theme" type with "standard" attributes for text edits,
  completions, etc, and a fromTheme for each widget

* Get rid of Attr arguments to stuff, and use post-processing on the
  image to change attributes?
* Widgets that take a lot of "configuration" should either not take it
  (compose the attrs outside) or should take a record that has
  defaults

* newtype WidgetAction m = WidgetAction (Widget (m (WidgetAction m)))
  * runWidgetLoop :: WidgetAction IO -> IO ()

* Try to remove any mention of "Vty" and rename "VtyWidgets" to "FPWidgets"?

* Nicer navigation:
  * Keymap -> Eventmap
  * Add DirectionEntry event type, and move Grid to that position

* Use AddBounds or such instead of the maxBoundHack stuff
* Scroll, Grid are pretty ugly

* TextEdit:
  * Keep track of diffs
