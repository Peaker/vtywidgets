* How do I get addKeymapView to be flexible about layout?

  * Can associate a key with the overlay of the keymap view on top of
    the image...

* Scalability:
  * To allow for scalable widget hierarchies, I need to make sure
    getting the TermImage is O(display size) and not O(entire size). I
    need to make sure Grid is lazy about the stuff beyond the screen
    somehow -- how?

* Nicer navigation:
  * Keymap -> Eventmap
  * Add DirectionEntry event type, and move Grid to that position

* Scroll:
  * If I make a "follow-view", I need it to be in State, which makes
    it less composable...
  * Maybe need FRP framework so Scroll is exposed to all of the model
    changes, or maybe Scroll can get a history or such

* Grid:
  * Can remove "Item" because it is easily possible to do the
    translation to center of available size or such independently

* Cleanups:
  * Maybe succumb to inclusive/inclusive Haskell ranges?
  * Use AddLimits or such instead of the maxBoundHack stuff
  * Scroll, Grid are pretty ugly
  * Various "make" widget funcs, move various params that the
    SizeRange doesn't depend on to be imgarg

* TextEdit:
  * Keep track of diffs
