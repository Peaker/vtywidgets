* Nicer navigation:

  * Add DirectionEntry event type but then (Model -> k) is not enough
    for Grid, because it gets a "k" from applying DirectionEntry event
    to child, and ALSO has its own Model to change. So maybe (Model ->
    k -> k)? Or some other solution?

* Widgets that take a lot of "configuration" should either not take it
  (compose the attrs outside) or should take a record that has
  defaults

* newtype WidgetAction m = WidgetAction (Widget (m (WidgetAction m)))
  * runWidgetLoop :: WidgetAction IO -> IO ()

* Try to remove any mention of "Vty" and rename "VtyWidgets" to "FPWidgets"?

* Use AddBounds or such instead of the maxBoundHack stuff
* Scroll, Grid are pretty ugly

* TextEdit:
  * Keep track of diffs
