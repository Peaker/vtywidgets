* Giving wrong size to main widget: Can just write the debug info to /tmp/debugLog...

* (Keymap view + Grid) determine the size range, which determines the
  size given to grid, which determines the keymap, which ...

  * How should it work?  Have Overlay 

* There seems to be a problem with the size allocation, the inner grid
  has a vertical spacer in it, but isn't getting the extra vertical
  space. It's as if the maximum size of the grid and the keymap
  somehow becomes min between their max sizes rather than max.

* Nicer navigation:
  * Keymap -> Eventmap
  * Add DirectionEntry event type, and move Grid to that position

* Scroll:
  * If I make a "follow-view", I need it to be in State, which makes
    it less composable...
  * Maybe need FRP framework so Scroll is exposed to all of the model
    changes, or maybe Scroll can get a history or such

* Cleanups:
  * Maybe succumb to inclusive/inclusive Haskell ranges?
  * Use AddLimits or such instead of the maxBoundHack stuff
  * Scroll, Grid are pretty ugly
  * Various "make" widget funcs, move various params that the
    SizeRange doesn't depend on to be imgarg

* TextEdit:
  * Keep track of diffs
